 LILYGO T-Display-S3 2-Colour LED Project
 
 Description:
   This code controls a two-colour LED connected to a LilyGO T-Display-S3 microcontroller board.
   
   It displays operating mode, colour changes, and button presses directly on the built-in screen using
   the TFT_eSPI library.
   
   The project demonstrates embedded programming concepts, including:

   - Digital Outputs: Controlling the RGB LED by setting the state of GPIO pins.
   - Variables: Storing and manipulating data, such as the current LED colour.
   - Enumerations (Enums): Defining named constants for colors and operational modes,
     improving code readability.
   - Functions: Place code into reusable blocks for better organization and modularity.
   - State Machines: Implementing different operational modes (automatic or manual colour changes)
     based on the program's current state.
   - Button Handling: Using the OneButton library to manage button short and long presses for
     responsive user interaction.
   - TFT_eSPI Library: Utilising the TFT_eSPI graphics library for direct display control.
 
 How It Works:

   1. LED Control: The code manages an LED, capable of producing Red, Green & when combined
       it's an Orangy-Yellow.
   2. Automatic Mode: The LED cycles through colors automatically, changing every second.
   3. Manual Mode: The user can manually change the LED colour with each button press.
   4. Button Interaction: The onboard "KEY" button (GPIO14) serves two purposes:
      - Short Press: In Manual Mode, a short press cycles the LED to the next colour.
      - Long Press (1 second): Switches between Automatic and Manual modes.
   5. TFT_eSPI Display: The project utilises the TFT_eSPI library for displaying status,
       colour information, and button state directly on the screen.
 
 Core Concepts and Benefits:
   - Helper Functions: Improve code organization, reusability, and maintainability.
   - Enums: Enhance code readability by using descriptive names instead of raw numbers.
   - State Machines: Simplify the management of different program behaviors and modes.
   - OneButton Library: Provides a robust way to handle button presses and long presses without
      requiring complex interrupt management.
   - TFT_eSPI: Allows for direct control of the display, enabling direct feedback and state information
      without the need of the serial monitor.
 
 Pin Connections:
   - Red LED        -> GPIO1
   - Green LED      -> GPIO2
   - Button         -> GPIO14 (built-in KEY button)
   - LCD Backlight  -> GPIO15
   - Ground         -> GND
 
 Notes:
   - The OneButton library simplifies button handling by debouncing and detecting short and long presses.
   - The TFT_eSPI library is configured to work with the LilyGO T-Display-S3, providing an easy way to
      display information on the built-in screen.
   - The code uses a state machine to manage the automatic and manual colour change modes, ensuring
      clean and maintainable logic.
   - Helper functions are moved into a .h file which is then included in main.cpp to make the project
      even "cleaner" and easier to maintain.
